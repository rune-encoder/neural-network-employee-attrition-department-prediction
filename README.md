# Multi-Task Neural Network for Employee Attrition & Department Prediction

## Description  
This project implements a multi-task neural network model to predict employee **Attrition** (Yes/No) and their **Department** (Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales). The model incorporates advanced techniques like shared layers, layer normalization, dropout regularization to achieve robust predictions.

## Model Development  

### Feature Engineering and Inspection  
- **Data Encoding:**  
   - Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and numerical variables were scaled using `StandardScaler`.  
   - Only features with high correlation or importance to the target were retained to minimize noise.  

---

### Shared Layers  
The shared layers form the backbone of the model, allowing both tasks (Attrition and Department prediction) to leverage common patterns:  
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers with increasing capacity for learning complex patterns.  
- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes activations to stabilize and accelerate training.  
- **ReLU Activation:** Adds non-linearity, essential for learning relationships in data.  
- **Dropout:** A rate of 10%-20% was applied to prevent overfitting while maintaining model capacity.

### Branch-Specific Layers  
Separate layers for **Attrition** and **Department**:  
- **Attrition:** Binary classification with a `sigmoid` activation for a Yes/No output.  
- **Department:** Multiclass classification with a `softmax` activation to output probabilities for three categories.  

## Results  

### **Accuracy and Loss Metrics**  
- **Attrition Task:**  
  - Accuracy: **88.04%**  
  - Loss: **0.324**  

- **Department Task:**  
  - Accuracy: **97.28%**  
  - Loss: **0.086**  

- **Overall Loss:** **0.412**
